# First promises
Created 2 promises `promise1` and `promise2`.
- `promise1` should be resolved on a `click` on `.logo`.
- `promise2` promise should be rejected in 3 seconds.
- add success and error handlers for both promises
- success handler should append a `<div class="message">` with the text `Promise was resolved!` to the body
- error handler should append a `<div class="message error-message">` with the text `Promise was rejected!` to the body
